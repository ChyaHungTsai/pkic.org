# Post-Quantum Cryptography Conference 2025

**Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia | Hybrid Event | October 28 – 30, 2025**

The PKI Consortium invites researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to submit abstracts for presentation at the [PQC Conference 2025 in Kuala Lumpur](/events/2025/pqc-conference-kuala-lumpur-my/), a premier global forum for advancing and applying Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

As the quantum era approaches, the urgency to future-proof digital security infrastructures is accelerating. This conference will bring together global and regional experts to explore the **strategic and technical dimensions** of PQC, with special focus on **real-world implementation, cryptographic agility, and Asia-Pacific leadership**.

> The program committee reviews abstracts regularly, so we encourage you to submit early at [pkic.org/call](/call)!

## Conference Format

The three-day event will feature:

* **Day 1**: **Hands-on Workshops & Technical Training**  
* **Days 2–3**: Expert Talks across **Two Parallel Tracks**:  
    * **Strategic Track** – for executives, CISOs, and policy makers  
    * **Technical Track** – for cryptographers, developers, and engineers

## Submission Tracks & Topics

We welcome original, high-quality abstracts for **talks, panel discussions, and workshops** related to PQC and quantum-resilient cryptography, including **but not limited** to the following categories:

### Technical Track – Topics of Interest

* PQC algorithm performance, benchmarking, and deployment  
* Cryptographic migration strategies (hybrid schemes, crypto agility)  
* PQC in constrained environments (IoT, embedded systems)  
* Implementation challenges, toolchains, and interoperability  
* Cryptanalysis of NIST standard and alternate algorithms  
* Side-channel resistance and secure hardware implementations  
* PQC in real-world protocols: TLS, SSH, VPN, email, and secure messaging  
* Quantum-safe libraries, SDKs, and open-source contributions  
* AI/ML-assisted cryptanalysis or optimization of PQC  
* Transitioning to PQC in enterprise software stacks

### Strategic Track – Topics of Interest

* Executive strategies for quantum readiness and crypto modernization  
* Risk management frameworks and investment prioritization  
* Regulatory and compliance considerations in the quantum transition  
* Global and regional policy updates (NIST, ETSI, ISO, national roadmaps)  
* PQC in digital identity, signatures, and public key infrastructure (PKI)  
* Sector-specific case studies such as in finance, healthcare, government, telecom, automotive, aviation, energy & critical infrastructure, cloud & data center services, defense & national security, e-commerce & digital identity, smart cities & IoT ecosystems  
* Asia-Pacific leadership in PQC innovation and deployment  
* Supply chain trust and quantum resilience  
* Public-private collaboration models for secure transitions  
* Harmonizing global standards with regional regulatory requirements

### Regional Emphasis: Asia-Pacific Perspectives

We especially encourage contributions that highlight:

* Regional PQC initiatives, research, and pilot programs  
* Policy developments and regulatory readiness in Asia  
* Case studies from ASEAN countries and APAC organizations  
* Localization challenges and multilingual security solutions

## Workshop & Training Topics

We invite proposals for **interactive, hands-on workshops and technical training sessions** that equip attendees with the skills and tools needed to navigate and implement post-quantum cryptography in real-world environments.

Workshops should be practical, engaging, and preferably include working code, configuration labs, or tooling demonstrations. Suggested topics include (but are not limited to):

### Post-Quantum Cryptography in Practice

* Implementing PQC in TLS 1.3: hands-on with ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and hybrid schemes  
* Building and integrating quantum-safe libraries in C, Rust, Go, or Python  
* Developing and testing PQC-enabled protocols (e.g., SSH, IPsec, QUIC, DNSSEC)  
* Performance profiling and benchmarking of PQC algorithms on real-world systems

### Crypto Agility & Transition Readiness

* Designing crypto-agile systems: architectures, APIs, and lifecycle management  
* Building hybrid cryptographic schemes to enable seamless PQC transition  
* Architecting for algorithm agility in regulated and legacy environments  
* Case studies and toolkits for crypto versioning and rollback strategies

### Cryptographic Inventory & Software Bill of Materials (SBOM/CBOM)

* Conducting cryptographic inventory and risk classification across your stack  
* Building and maintaining Cryptographic Bills of Materials (CBOMs)  
* Leveraging Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) to track and manage cryptographic dependencies  
* Automating crypto inventory discovery using static and dynamic analysis tools  
* Integrating PQC readiness into DevSecOps pipelines and compliance workflows

### Tooling & Development Ecosystem

* Intro to post-quantum toolchains and SDKs (e.g., Open Quantum Safe, liboqs, Bouncy Castle PQC)  
* PQC validation and conformance testing: fuzzing, formal methods, and static analysis  
* Secure key management in a quantum-safe context: key rotation, storage, HSMs  
* Creating and signing post-quantum X.509 certificates

### Risk Modeling & Threat Simulations

* Simulating quantum attacks and estimating crypto deprecation timelines  
* Quantum risk assessment frameworks tailored for enterprises and governments  
* Scenario planning and tabletop exercises for crypto breach recovery
