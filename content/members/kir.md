KIR is a key entity of the Polish payment system infrastructure. Based on state-of-the-art technologies, we build solutions for digital processes in business and administration. We specialize in remote identity authentication, secure data exchange, settlements and open banking.

For the last 30 years KIR handles a vast majority of interbank transactions in Poland. Along with our experience in the area of digitalization of the Polish payment system, we have gained a well-funded know-how professionally used for developing customized business solutions for banking, finance, insurance, leasing, medical services, energy and telecommunications.

For several decades, we have been offering key certification services as part of the Szafir Electronic Signature Service Center. In this respect, we provide trust services such as qualified certificates of electronic signature, qualified certificates of electronic seal, qualified certificates of website authentication and qualified electronic time stamps. The e-signature Szafir, issued by KIR to companies, institutions and individual persons, has become a market standard that guarantees reliable personal identification and confirms data integrity in business and public administration.

We also provide new and innovative tools for e-identity online (mojeID) and mobile e-signature (mSzafir), securing the needs of citizens and clients. Thanks to mojeID and mSzafir, millions of people in Poland can interact with public institutions and commercial entities at a time and place of their choice. The companies can reduce their operating costs by going paperless and optimize their business models by accelerating time-consuming HR, sales, procurement or logistics processes.

Our solutions help our partners to unlock their potential and implement innovations. We bring together different market players, sharing knowledge and competences tested in practice. We believe that interoperability, cross-sectoral and cross-market cooperation is the key to sustainable development of digital services.
